# DemoMVVMApp
Clean MVVM Architecture I like to follow for apps I build
- technologies & Libraries Used:
  - Koin for DI (Koin is more concise and straightforward than the other DI frameworks. It is perfect for encapsulated feature/library modules.)
  - okhttp3 for making network calls
  - Retrofit (retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST api call)
  - Moshi (for parsing JSON into Java and Kotlin classes)
